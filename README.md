Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I would like to discuss with my peers on best UI customization options for the Flicks app
2. I would like to discuss how to use Git Desktop to submit my Xcode project.
